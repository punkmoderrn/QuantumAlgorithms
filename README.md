# Quantum Algorithms Projects

## VQE for H2 molecule
This project implements the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) for the H2 molecule using Qiskit. 
It demonstrates basic usage of quantum circuits for finding ground-state energies.

- Python 3.11
- Qiskit 1.4
- Includes detailed comments explaining each step of the algorithm. 

Some of this work is part of my current exploration in variational quantum algorithms.
